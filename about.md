Hi, I'm Brian Gregg and I am a software engineer at [GrubHub](https://www.grubhub.com) in Chicago, IL. Before that, I worked at [Morningstar](http://www.morningstar.com) and [Cisco](http://www.cisco.com).

### Extracurriculars

I have been working on many side projects for the past few years:

- [OpenNest](https://github.com/baritonehands/opennest), an open source Nest using a Raspberry Pi
- [NuGet Jenkins](https://github.com/baritonehands/jenkinsnuget), a NuGet CI plugin for Jenkins
- [TicTacToe10](https://www.facebook.com/tictactoeten), a more challenging twist on Tic Tac Toe. Available for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone.

### What I Do For Fun

- [Sugar Mama and the Gold Diggers](https://www.facebook.com/sugarmamaband), a classic and alternative rock cover band.
- [Board Games](http://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/baritonehands), the more complicated the better.
